	abstract = {Due to the unsupervised nature of anomaly detection, the key to fueling deep models is finding supervisory signals. Different from current reconstruction-guided generative models and transformation-based contrastive models, we devise novel data-driven supervision for tabular data by introducing a characteristic -- scale -- as data labels. By representing varied sub-vectors of data instances, we define scale as the relationship between the dimensionality of original subvectors and that of representations. Scales serve as labels attached to transformed representations, thus offering ample labeled data for neural network training. This paper further proposes a scale learningbased anomaly detection method. Supervised by the learning objective of scale distribution alignment, our approach learns the ranking of representations converted from varied subspaces of each data instance. Through this proxy task, our approach models inherent regularities and patterns within data, which well describes data "normality". Abnormal degrees of testing instances are obtained by measuring whether they fit these learned patterns. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to significant improvement over state-of-the-art generative/contrastive anomaly detection methods.},

@inproceedings{odae,
	abstract = { Abstract In this paper, we introduce autoencoder ensembles for unsupervised outlier detection. One problem with neural networks is that they are sensitive to noise and often require large data sets to work robustly, while increasing data size makes them slow. As a result, there are only a few existing works in the literature on the use of neural networks in outlier detection. This paper shows that neural networks can be a very competitive technique to other existing methods. The basic idea is to randomly vary on the connectivity architecture of the autoencoder to obtain significantly better performance. Furthermore, we combine this technique with an adaptive sampling method to make our approach more efficient and effective. Experimental results comparing the proposed approach with state-of-the-art detectors are presented on several benchmark data sets showing the accuracy of our approach. },

@article{scCNC,
	abstract = {{A large number of studies have shown that clustering is a crucial step in scRNA-seq analysis. Most existing methods are based on unsupervised learning without the prior exploitation of any domain knowledge, which does not utilize available gold-standard labels. When confronted by the high dimensionality and general dropout events of scRNA-seq data, purely unsupervised clustering methods may not produce biologically interpretable clusters, which complicate cell type assignment.In this article, we propose a semi-supervised clustering method based on a capsule network named scCNC that integrates domain knowledge into the clustering step. Significantly, we also propose a Semi-supervised Greedy Iterative Training method used to train the whole network. Experiments on some real scRNA-seq datasets show that scCNC can significantly improve clustering performance and facilitate downstream analyses.The source code of scCNC is freely available at https://github.com/WHY-17/scCNC.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}},

Through its seamless compatibility with the Seurat package, Signac facilitates the analysis of diverse multimodal single-cell chromatin data, including datasets that co-assay DNA accessibility with gene expression, protein abundance and mitochondrial genotype. We demonstrate scaling of the Signac framework to analyze datasets containing over 700,000 cells.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes to use autoencoders with nonlinear dimensionality reduction in the anomaly detection task. The authors apply dimensionality reduction by using an autoencoder onto both artificial data and real data, and compare it with linear PCA and kernel PCA to clarify its property. The artificial data is generated from Lorenz system, and the real data is the spacecrafts' telemetry data. This paper demonstrates that autoencoders are able to detect subtle anomalies which linear PCA fails. Also, autoencoders can increase their accuracy by extending them to denoising autoenconders. Moreover, autoencoders can be useful as nonlinear techniques without complex computation as kernel PCA requires. Finaly, the authors examine the learned features in the hidden layer of autoencoders, and present that autoencoders learn the normal state properly and activate differently with anomalous input.},
